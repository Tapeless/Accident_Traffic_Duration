# Accident_Traffic_Duration

## Overview

This repo's main feature is a model trained on the [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) that predicts the length of time an accident will impact traffic given features that can be known immediately (weather conditions, day/time, nearby road features). Individual predictions can be made and evaluated via the Flask app (app.py), and further discussion is included on the web app.

## Usage

### Libraries

- numpy
- pandas
- xgboost
- joblib
- json
- plotly
- flask
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

For any usage, it is recommended to install the required packages - requirements files are included for pip and conda package managers.
If using pip, create a new environment through your environment manager if needed to avoid updating system package versions!

  1. `cd` into top-level directory for this repo
  2. `pip install -r pipreqs.txt` for pip, `conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt` for conda
     - **Note**: if on a non-windows system, comment out pywin32 & pywinty lines, otherwise this will error

For the web app:
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the top-level directory
3. `flask run`
4. Visit the address shown in the CLI ([127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/))
5. Fill out the fields in the webpage to generate a prediction given different input features

For data_processing.ipynb:
1. Download the [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) and extract to the top-level directory of this repo
2. `jupyter lab` via CLI, or preferred interface for python notebooks
3. Work through the cells top-down

For model_exploration.ipynb:
1. Generate the `cleaned_data.csv` from data_processing.ipynb
1. Work through the cells! The GridSearchCV cell will take a long time, so I would recommend skipping unless modifying to develop a stronger model.

### Results

Using xgboost's softprobability classifier with gridsearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, we are able to achieve an accuracy score of 0.63 (0.64 on the test set.)
The most performant parameters were learning_rate: 0.1, max_depth: 18, n_estimators: 200.
